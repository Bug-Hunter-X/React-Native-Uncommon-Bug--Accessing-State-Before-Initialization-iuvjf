# React Native: Accessing State Before Initialization

This repository demonstrates a common yet tricky error in React Native: accessing state variables before they've been initialized.  The `Bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `BugSolution.js` provides a solution.

## Problem

Attempting to access state variables within the render method or other lifecycle methods before React has had a chance to set the initial state leads to undefined values and runtime errors. This is often exacerbated by asynchronous operations or complex component structures.

## Solution

The solution involves using conditional rendering or the `useEffect` hook to ensure the state is ready before being used. Conditional rendering checks for `null` or `undefined` before rendering the element that depends on the state, while `useEffect` provides a place to handle state initialization and run code after the component has mounted.
